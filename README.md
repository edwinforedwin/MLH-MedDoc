# MLH-MedDoc
Medical data stored on blockchain | Ethereum | Smart Contracts | NodeJS

Years of heavy regulation and bureaucratic inefficiency have slowed innovation for the medical records (EMRs).We now face a critical need of such innovation as personalization and data science prompt patients to engage in the details of their healthcare and restore agaency over their medical data. We introduce 'MEDDOC', a novel decentralized record management system to handlle EMR's

Usage guidlines:

needed frameworks

1 : Ganache 

2 : Truffle

3 : IPFS

4 : MetaMask

5 : php local server

Running Mechanisms:

1 : Open Ganache and configure with local host : 7545 server


2 : Configure MetaMask using the menonomic that available in the Ganache

3 : Run 'truffle compile' and 'truffle migrate' commands in the 'contracts' directory

4 : run IPFS daemon for data back up

5 : Run src files in the 'localhost:3000'

Here goes the DApp of EMR !!!
